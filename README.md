## Features:
- Scan directories and sub-directories for video files.
- Search Wikipedia for episode titles.
- Edit episode titles before committing changes.
- TODO: Preview changes before committing.

## Requirements:
- Files must be named properly to have the script move through the files in the same order as the show's timeline.

### Filename Format
Shows must be in a directory of the same name. They can be broken into sub-directories to separate seasons and parts.

The recommended filename format is as follows:
`'Anime Name'/'Season 1'/'Part 1'/S01E01.mkv`
